\section{Introduction}

%0
The spatial distribution of the nearest galaxies on scales of a few
hundreds of Megaparsecs follows a distinct filamentary motif.
This pattern receives the name of cosmic web and has been observed at
different cosmic epochs.  
The search of consistent and stable methods to define this web has
been the subject of continous research for the last 40 years since its
existence was confirmed in early cosmic maps from galaxy redshift surveys.
The cosmic web has also been confirmed both in large galaxy surveys
and also in the dark matter description provided by cosmological
simulations.  

The cosmic web is usually split into four different components: peaks,
sheets, filaments and voids.
There is a great variety of methods to find these components. 
Most of them are focused on the two most prominent features in galaxy
surveys: voids and filaments. 
The voids are regions with sizes on the range of $20-50$ Mpc
practically devoid of galaxies, see XXX for a recent review of
void finder algorithms.
The filaments appear to be the main bridges connecting high
density regions. 
On the largest scales the filament lenght can be on the order of
$10-100$ Mpc.
See XXX for a recent review of cosmic web finders that are able to
characterize filaments. 

The expected statistical isotropy of the cosmic web can also be used
as a cosmological test via the Alcoc-Paczynski (AP) test. 
The result of this test are promissing to constrain cosmological
parameters when put together with other
probes such as the measurement of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO)
feature, quantifications redshift space  (RSD) on the correlation
funcctio. 


In this paper we introduce the $\beta$-skeleton as an algorithm to
characterize the cosmic web. 
The $\beta$-skeleton concept stems from the fields of computational geometry
and geometric graph theory and has been widely applied in the areas of
image analysis, machine learning, visual perception and pattern
recognition. 
This skeleton is a graph that has as nodes the observed or simulated
galaxy distribution, such graph can also be used o

This paper is organized as follows. 
In Section 2, we briefly introduce the definition and the basic properties of the $\beta$-skeleton. 
In Section 3, we describe the Big MultiDark Planck (BigMDPL) simulation and the SDSS-III BOSS Data Release 12 (DR12) galaxy sample, which are used later on in the analysis. 
The application of the $\beta$-skeleton statistics is presented in Section 4, 
where we discuss the dependence of the skeleton on the values of $\beta$, 
on the redshift of the various samples, on the redshift-space distortions (RSDs), and on the cosmological volume and Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effects; 
we also graphically illustrate the $\beta$-skeleton constructed from SDSS-III BOSS DR12 galaxies,
and eventually compare the skeletons obtained from observational data and simulated catalogs.  
Finally, we summarize our findings and conclude in Section 5.
